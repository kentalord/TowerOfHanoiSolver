# TowerOfHanoiSolver
There are K pegs. Each peg can hold discs in decreasing order of radius when looked from from bottom to top of the peg. There are N disc which hav radius to 1 to N. Given the initial configuration of the pegs and the final of the pegs, output the moves required to transform from the initial to the final configuration.
This program takes 3 string inputs.
The first line of input will consist of N and K, 3 <= K.
The second line contains N integers. Each integer is in the range of 1 to K where i-th integer denotes the peg to which disc radius i is presen in the initial configuration.
The third line denotes the final configuaration in the format similar to the inital one.

Example:
6 4
4 2 4 3 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1
